synthetic asynchronous processing in javascript

Thaw.js helps keep the browser from freezing by splitting long computations into small parts which are processed more naturally when the browser isn't busy.  This simulates asynchronous behaviour and keeps the browser from freezing.  Thaw.ts thaws frozen browsers.
